Runtime Creation:

1.	create a form
2.	handle various form events through eventahdlerfunctions
3.	Device requires a form, presentation parameters[], adapter, creation flags



Event Handling:
note: eventhandler objects contain method pointers same like delegate objects
so custom events's handlers will be delegates.. 

4.	Create some delegates for handling keyboard and mouse events
5.  Create custom events whose handlers are the previous delegates
6.	Actual events on the form should rasie custom events with enumerated arguments
7.  Assign to those delegates actual fuctions that form the logic of the game



Game Story (Control Path):
8.  Run() function must form.Show then, while (form.Created)
	{ 'check for render'(fail: do events) and must raise idle(custom)event and present() }
	and do events.
9.  present() must call device.Present() or set devicelost if exception occurs.
10. 'check for render' => CheckCooperativeLevel((ResultCode)int) and must resetdevice 
    or set devicelost
11.
