Userstate :

		"There are potentially two overloads for the asynchronous operations:
		single-invocation and multiple-invocation. You can distinguish these two forms by 
		their method signatures: the multiple-invocation form has an extra parameter called
		userState. This form makes it possible for your code to call Method1Async(string param,
		object userState) multiple times without waiting for any pending asynchronous operations 
		to finish. If, on the other hand, you try to call Method1Async(string param) before a 
		previous invocation has completed, the method raises an InvalidOperationException.

		The userState parameter for the multiple-invocation overloads allows you to distinguish 
		among asynchronous operations. You provide a unique value (for example, a GUID or hash 
		code) for each call to Method1Async(string param, object userState), and when each operation
		is completed, your event handler can determine which instance of the operation raised the
		completion event."

		Multiple Async Ops need a user state object.
