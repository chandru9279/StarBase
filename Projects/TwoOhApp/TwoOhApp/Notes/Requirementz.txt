      scheduled events info and tasks info (each in a different screen/tab)
      to the user on the desktop.
      
   2. App has a tray icon - with menu options to view each of the above,
      set options and exit.
      
   3. Balloon tips from the tray icon at the reminder times of the scheduled events.
   
   4. App should connect to the webservice once an hour (would be good to have 
      this in the options) to sync with the web server.
      
   5. App should work fine when no net connection is available also.
   
   6. App should be localized to tamil as well



   1. Checkout how to call the web services asynchronously... 
      That will be better, since otherwise the app will hang until it 
      gets response from the webservice.
      
   2. Find how to authenticate the user. We need to pass the username 
      and password to the webservice - check out the best practice to 
      authenticate a user with a webservice.


You can then define a dummy web service which will have methods like - 
GetContacts, GetScheduledEvents, GetTasks() which will return the following:


Contacts            - name, mobile, phone, email, website, tags

Schedule events     - schedule name, description, repository name,
                      target group/user, created user, start time,
                      end time, reminder time
                  
Tasks               - name, description, repository name, target group/user,
                      created user, start date, due date, priority, percent complete
