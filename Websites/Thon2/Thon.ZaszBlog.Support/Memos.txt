[Support] :

	BlogSettings class exposes the static singleton instance of itself which exposes all the settings
	of ZaszBlog . The first time static instance is referred a new instance is created and Load() is 
	called which calls StaticDataService.LoadSettings() which loads settings from 
	_SettingsFolder + "ZaszBlogSettings.xml" where _SettingsFolder = 
	C:\Users\Zasz\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\WebSites\ThonZNet\App_Data\ZaszBlog\
	
	StaticSearch associates event handlers for 1. showable-entities-save & Comment-approval, 2. BlogSettings-change,
	One: Will build catalog consisting of "Entry"s or do AddItem which adds another "Entry" to catalog,
	Two: will rebuild catalog,
	Catalog building is done by a series of AddItem s, AddItem uses StopWords.txt to clean the content
	of the entry while cleaning html too,
	BuildResultSet() returns a ranked result set for any given string, with comment search enabled or not,
	Hits() BuildResultSet with given search term, with comment search enabled or not,
	FindRelatedItems() does Hits(search term='title+all category-titles') with comment search disabled.

[Support.CodedRepresentations] :

	All business entities - post,page & category extend abstract BusinessBase class .
	All showable entities - post, comment, page implement IShowed .


	DataSelect, DataUpdate, DataInsert, DataDelete are implemented by business entities
	as specified in BusinessBase .

[Support.DataServicesAndConfiguration] :

	These in turn call the proxy "StaticDataService" class's static methods which loads providers 
	and the default provider using "StorageProviderSection" and calls the default provider's methods .


	All providers must extend the "StorageProvider" class which enforces subclasses to implement
	all the methods which the "StaticDataService" class will call .

[Support.XmlProvider] :

	ALL CLASS FILES IN THE XMLPROVIDER FOLDER/NAMESPACE (have 'partial' and so) FORM THE 'SAME' CLASS :
	"XmlStorageProvider" which inherits from StorageProvider, and implements
	all the methods which the "StaticDataService" class will call .


	"XmlStorageProvider" requires the data stoarge location to store the xml files and access
	them, which is present in the internal static _Folder (Internal types or members are accessible
	only within files in the same assembly) variable in the StorageLocation class
	file, which is inited from the BlogSettings singleton instance, which gets the value from, say 
	settings.xml .
	
[Support.Web.Controls] :

	BlogBasePage - Adds all the links every page must provide such as :
	MetaContentType SyndicationLink JavaScriptKeys GenericLink CustomCodeToHead TrackingScript 
	OpenSearchLinkInHeader.. These allow us to hook up features like google analytics
