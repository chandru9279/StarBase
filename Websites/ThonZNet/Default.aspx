			<p>Just wired up the site with Monster http handlers and Google Analytics, thinking 
                    about placing ads, is that a good idea?</p>
		
		
			<h3>Welcome	to the Site</h3>
			<p>This	is the Thiagarajan family personal site. In	it you will find weekly (in 
                future daily) updates on the variety of activities happening. Since I&#39;m looking 
                to bring up a full featured Web Content Management System as part of this site, 
                along with a lot of other Tid-Bits you won&#39;t find this coming out of beta for a 
                while now.</p>

			<hr	/>
			<p>Will provide a download link in short order .. best way is to run a subversion 
                server on the host, which must be discussed with the hosting provider, soon 
                after which everyone will be able to obtain a working copy of this site, 
                licensed under MS-PL (Microsoft Permissive License) . Be happy if you can 
                provide feedback on the working and performance, and anything else i should 
                know.</p>
